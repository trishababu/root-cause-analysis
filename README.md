GMM Ticket Clustering with Text Summarization
This repository contains code that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and clustering to analyze and group similar ticket/issue summaries. The goal is to help identify recurring issues and themes in ticket data, enabling efficient ticket management.

Features
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, lowercasing, lemmatization, and removal of stopwords and special characters to clean the input data.
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text data into numerical feature vectors using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), which reflects the importance of words in the dataset.
Clustering with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM): Clusters the ticket summaries based on their semantic similarity, grouping them into predefined clusters.
PCA Visualization: Provides a 2D scatter plot visualization of the clustered data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
Cluster Summarization: Generates a summary of the top keywords for each cluster, giving insights into the themes of the grouped tickets.
Cluster Prediction: Predicts the cluster for a new ticket/issue based on its summary.
Installation

pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn matplotlib
Usage
Preprocess and Cluster Tickets:
The script preprocesses the ticket summaries by removing unwanted characters and lemmatizing the text. Then, it uses the TF-IDF vectorizer to convert the text into numerical data, which is used by the GMM to cluster the tickets.

Generate Clustering Visualization:
After clustering, the tickets are visualized using PCA to reduce the feature space to two dimensions. This allows the visualization of clusters on a 2D scatter plot.

Summarize Clusters:
The script provides summaries for each cluster, showing the top keywords that describe the clusterâ€™s theme.

Predict Cluster for New Tickets:
The script allows for predicting the cluster of a new ticket based on its summary, enabling classification of future tickets.

Example
To run the code, execute the following:

python
Copy code
# Running the clustering and visualization process
python yourscript.py
Example of predicting a new ticket's cluster:

python
Copy code
# Example: Predicting cluster for a new ticket
new_ticket_summary = "site notification"
predicted_cluster = predict_cluster(new_ticket_summary)
print(f'The new ticket belongs to cluster: {predicted_cluster}')
Input Data Format
The input data file (dataset.csv) should have a single column Issue_id_Summary, which contains the issue ID followed by the ticket summary, separated by a tab character (\t).

Example:

vbnet
Copy code
Issue_id_Summary
12345\tSystem error occurred in application
23456\tUser unable to login to the portal
Output
Visualization: The script will generate and save a PNG file (gmm_clustering_visualization.png) that shows the clusters in 2D space.
Clustered Data: The clustered tickets are saved to a CSV file (grouped_tickets_gmm.csv), which includes the assigned cluster for each ticket.
Cluster Summaries: Top keywords for each cluster are printed to the console.
